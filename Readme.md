# NVIDIA and LlamaIndex Developer Contest
In this repository I have the submission to the "NVIDIA and LlamaIndex Developer Contest", for reference https://developer.nvidia.com/llamaindex-developer-contest

## Description
I have created a small RAG application which allow to extract information from unstructured data. In this case from pdf files, but with few modifications we can extend its functionality to extract from other formats. The best description of this application is "Speak with your Data"

Main Technolgies use in this application are:
- Nvidia NIM 
- LLamaIndex
- StreamLit
- Docker
- Python 3.11
